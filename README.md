# hello-world
My first Easy Bake Repository!
Hi all. This is my first foray into GitHub. I'm following the initial tutorial, because I want to be able to get all I can from this. I hope to be working with everyone soon. 
I am working on learning C#, Java, and Python. I had some college level courses, but that was with C++ and VB, and only a year's worth of classes with both. Not very in depth. Also, I took Object Oriented Design, and Data Structures, but I remember nothing of them. It was more than ten years ago, and I wasn't a very good student.
